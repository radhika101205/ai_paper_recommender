#  Research Paper Publishability Classifier  
###  Built for IIT Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2025 

This project is an **AI-powered framework** designed to classify research papers as **“Publishable”** or **“Non-Publishable”** using natural language processing and machine learning. The system was developed as part of **Task 1** of the **Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (KDSH) 2025**, organized by IIT Kharagpur and Pathway.

##  Objective

In the academic research domain, manually reviewing papers is time-consuming and subjective. The goal of this task was to automate the evaluation process and build a framework that detects:
- Inappropriate methodologies  
- Illogical or incoherent arguments  
- Unrealistic claims without proper validation  

Our model was trained to accurately identify these indicators and classify papers accordingly.

##  Key Features

- **BERT-based embedding** of paper abstracts and titles
- **Supervised classifiers**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- **98% accuracy** on labeled validation data
- Systematic detection of vague methods, incoherent claims, or weak argument structure
- Scalable architecture for larger datasets

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Transformers (BERT via Hugging Face)**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
